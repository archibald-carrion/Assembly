# X86 Assembly algorithms and scripts collection

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in x86 assembly language. Each implementation serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource for understanding low-level programming concepts.

## Currently Implemented Algorithms

### Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
A Linear Feedback Shift Register implementation in x86 assembly. LFSR is commonly used in cryptography, digital communications, and random number generation.

### Integer Square Function
A simple integer squaring function implemented in x86 assembly. This function squares an integer input and returns the result.

### TODO: Add already implemented algorithms here

## Requirements, build, and execution
Each algorithm implementation contains its own set of requirements, build instructions, and execution steps. Please refer to the respective README files in each algorithm's directory for detailed information.

## Planned Algorithms
The following algorithms are planned for future implementation:
- [ ] Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- [ ] AES Encryption/Decryption
- [ ] SHA-256 Hashing
- [ ] RSA Key Generation
